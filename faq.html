                        If this is enabled, the user will see your business address where they need to pick up goods
                        from.

                        <strong>UPI handle or payment URL</strong> <br>
                        Enter any UPI handle where you want to receive payments. UPI is free and has the benefit of
                        instant transfer.
                        <br>
                        Important: When you activate this method, the customer journey is as follows
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Customer adds items to cart and swipes to place order</li>
                        <li>Customer comes to ORDERS section and clicks on MAKE PAYMENT</li>
                        <li>This opens up the available UPI apps through which they make payment</li>
                        <li>They click on MARK PAID and confirm payment
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        UPI transactions happen outside the app and hence customers need to manually confirm payment.

                        Modules make the core of your app-experience. Currently there are three key modules
                        around
                        which you build your app
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>BUY</strong>
                        <br>
                        This is the tab where your catalog comes up
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>CHAT</strong>
                        <br>
                        Essentially group chat

                    <p><strong>FEED</strong>
                        <br>
                        Business first communication where members can comment only on business posts
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can switch their positions to match your business needs and even switch off chat and feed
                        and only keep BUY too.

                        You can have one or multiple catalogs. Each catalog can have categories under which there can be

                        What is your catalog all about? Are there any important things like minimum order or estimated

                        You can also have advanced features to items like:

                    <p>
                        <strong>Item description</strong><br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Pre-discount price</strong> <br>
                        This is the slashed price where people see the original price. This helps customers
                        visualise the savings you provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Final Price</strong><br>
                        This is what the customer pays when they add the items to cart and place an order
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tax charges per item</strong><br>
                        Add any taxes that your product might incur. Incase of all-inclusive prices, leave this blank.+
                    </p>
                    <p> Tip: Use the bulk upload feature to upload tax charges in one-go while uploading products
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Packing charges per item</strong> <br>
                        In case you charge packaging at an item-level, this could be helpful. For eg: A lot of Pizza
                        outlets charge a box-price for pizza.

                        This is a superpower to manage your business! You can filter your order summary by
                        <strong>
                            payment, confirmations, and delivery status
                        </strong>
                        . Filtering can also be done via dates.

                    <p>
                        You can have multi-level filters too. For eg: Those who have paid and confirmed but not yet
                        delivered in between selected dates.

                        also necessary if you have activated
